1. FizzBuzz using FOR loops

1) FizzBuzz Rules
1. If a number is divisible by 3, print Fizz!
2. If a number is divisible by 5, print Buzz!
3. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz!
4. Enable a user to select the starting number and finish number 
5. The solution must contain a for loop!﻿


﻿ Project Clues
1. A function that produces a range of numbers could come in handy...
2. How well do you remember conditional statements?
3. An arithmetic operator that identifies a remainder of 0 could come in handy...
4. Think carefully about the order you put the rules...

2) FizzBuzz using WHILE Loops : implement same rules mentioned above.

3) Number Guessing Game
The goal of this game is to guess a secret number chosen by the computer within a limited number of attempts.
Game Rules:
• 	The computer randomly selects a number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
• 	The player has a fixed number of attempts (e.g., 7 tries) to guess the correct number.
• 	After each guess:
• 	If the guessed number is greater than the actual number, the game will display:
"Too high! Try a smaller number."
• 	If the guessed number is less than the actual number, the game will display:
"Too low! Try a larger number."
• 	If the player guesses the number correctly within the allowed attempts, they win the game.
• 	If the player fails to guess the number within the given attempts, the game ends with a loss message revealing the correct number.

4) Random Password Generator (Console App)

The objective of this program is to generate a secure password using random characters and display it to the user through a console interface.

# Requirements:
- The program should generate a password consisting of:
  - Random uppercase letters (A–Z)
  - Random lowercase letters (a–z)
  - Random digits (0–9)
  - Random special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- The password length should be fixed (e.g., 8–12 characters) or configurable by the user.
- The generated password must be:
  - Randomized  and unique each time the program runs.
  - Displayed clearly on the console (UI).
- The program should ensure that the password contains a mix of all character types for better security.

#Extension: CAPTCHA Functionality (Second Part)

In the next stage, students will extend this application to simulate a CAPTCHA-like functionality:
- Instead of just generating a password, the program will generate a random string (similar to CAPTCHA).
- The user will be asked to retype the string exactly as shown.
- If the input matches, the program confirms success; otherwise, it prompts the user to try again.
