# Basics of Python
# Data Structures : List, Tupes,Set, Dictionary etc
# function: Normal Function, Built- in function, 
# Python is aslo functional programming language :
# Closures and Decorator
# Error Handling
# Class and object
# Syntax of class
# Constructor
# Default, Non - parameterized, Parameterized Consructures.
# How to create an object
# type(), isinstance()
# __dict__ : rDictionary containing class's namespace
# __doc__: Class documentation string
# __name__ : Class name / current module name.

# Instance variables :  need to use it with self keyword.
                    : To modify them, we have instance methods( self)
# Class variables : Variables made for entire class.
                  : Only one copy is created and distributed to all objects
                  : Modification in class variable impact on all objects
                  : To modify them, we have class methods, which implements 
                    @classmethod decorator(cls)

# getter, setter:
# Built in methods : __getattribute__('attribute name')
         : __setattr__('attribute name','attribute value') 
# Custom instancemethods: setAttributeValue(), getAttributeValue()

# Instance Methods
# Class Methods
# Static Methods:
- Methods which performs operation on external data.
- It can also perform operations on class data.
- No need to pass object or class references.
- Created using decorator : @staticmethod
- use methods directly with class name.
- Clarity: Declares that the method doesn't depend on instance state.
- Organization: Keeps related untility functions inside the class instead of floating around as standalone functions
- Convenience: You don't need to instantiate Bank just to calculate interest.


# Inheritance:
- extending exisiting functionality to derived entities.
- inhert attributes, methods
- Parent class, Base class, Existing class or Super class
- Child class, sub class, derived class

# Super base / Super parent class to all is : built -in Object class
# type() ---> <class, 'class_name'>

# Single - level Inheriatnce : One Parent and One Class
 - ctor overrinding
 - variables overriding
 - ctor channing: super().__init__(nm,loc)

# Multi - level Inhertance : Parent class and child class further inherited into new class, forming multiple levels.

# Hierarchical Inheritance:
 One Parent and multiple child classes.

# Multiple Inheritance
 Class is derived from - multiple base classes
 
# Hybrid Inheritance

#---> search ---> child1(Emp) --> in base classes(A-> B->C : left to right)
# for example : class Emp(A,B,C):

# Polymorphism: same object with many form: +- 2,3=5,'a','b'='ab', len
