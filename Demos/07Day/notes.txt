# OOP: 
## Types of Inhertance
## Polymorphism
## Data Hiding

## Public, Private, Protected members

# @staticmethod
# @classmethod
# @property

# Design Patterns:
# common problems ==> common solution

# SOLID, DRY, principles -  guideline /common Rules

# Singleton Pattern
: Creatational Design Pattern : (Create an Object)
: Only one object per application should be allowed to get created and used.
1. : class Config:  we are reading config files.
# You restrict object creation to one object per application.
: create a class whos object can give only access to these config data
2. class Logger:
: we have decided to write a log in txt file.
: entire application log we need to write it in the same file.
: many modules -> via log -> logger writting it in a single txt file .c:/desktop/log.txt
// with open() as f:

# object pooling [obj1, obj2, obj3] : database operation application
            : Netflix app: subscription for family : devices allowed = 3 (mobile, mobile, TV)


# static
# Abstract, interface

# Example:
Db operations : insert, update, delete
Client: MySQL Db : insert, update, delete
2nd requirement: Oracle db server : insert, update, delete
3rd : MS SQl Server : insert, update, delete

# Single Responsibilty priciple
class MySQL:
def insert
def update
def delete
-------------------------------
# common : insert, update, delete : Prototype/ Template/ Open - contaract
# open contract : client and developer : public functionalities 
# repeat sam ecode bcoz of obj based dependency
# Object creation responsibility: Factory Pattern
# single object / Single method --> creates/ provides other class objects
